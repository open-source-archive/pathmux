# pathmux

Package pathmux is a fork of [httptreemux](https://github.com/dimfeld/httptreemux). This fork exposes the
interface of the internal tree lookup implementation of the original httptreemux package, and has the
http related wrapper code stripped off. When the use case is about method+path matching of http requests, it is
recommended to use the original httptreemux package.
